# What is Exoplanet Watch: 
A NASA citizen science project, sponsored by NASA that allows participants to gather and analyze real exoplanet data, contribute their results to a NASA database, and recieve recognition for their work in scientific publications!

# How do I conduct my research?
I use EXOTIC (Exoplanet Timing Interpretation Code) software to analyze data by generating reports and visual light curves.  I then send this to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). Exoplanet Watch incorporates this data into Exoplanet Watch Results.
