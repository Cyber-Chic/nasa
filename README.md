# What is Exoplanet Watch? 
- A citizen science project by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  It allows participants to gather and analyze exoplanet data, contribute their results to a NASA database, and receive recognition for their work in scientific publications. <br>

# What Are Exoplanets?
- Exoplanets are planets that exists beyond our solar system.  They typically orbit stars within our galaxy.  To learn more about exoplanets visit NASA's official website. <br> https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/facts/ <br><br>
# How Do I Conduct My Research?
- By using EXOTIC (Exoplanet Timing Interpretation Code) Python software to analyze data, generate reports, and create visual light curves.  I then send them to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). Exoplanet Watch incorporates this data into their results. <br> https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/exotic/user-guide/

# Why Are Light Curves Important?
- Light curve graphs demonstrate changes in brightness over a period of time.  When an exoplanet passes the front of a star, it blocks off the stars light.  This is represented by a dip on a light curve graph. Dips can provide a wealth of information about an exoplanet's year length, temperature, and atmosphere thickness. In short, the more often these dips occur the shorter the year and hotter the exoplanet. You can also note that the bigger a dip is, the bigger an exoplanet is.

# My Results <br><br> 1.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
- To view my results visit NASA's Exoplanet Watch Results page.  Next click on any exoplanet listed above and search for my AAVSO code which is: MANBA.  From there you can access the light curves I have generated.  Instructions on how to access my results are included on their page under "Find your light curve!"  Please note that their results are not updated daily.  If you are unable to locate an exoplanet, check back at a later date.

# 2. American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) 
- To view my light curves, reports and additional data visit the AAVSO website.  Next search for my Observers Code - MANBA. <br>https://apps.aavso.org/exosite <br><br>

# About Me
- I studied astronomy during my senior year at Fairfield University.  I've since developed a fascination with both programming & outer-space research. I love Exoplanet Watch because even as a novice, I'm able to use these passions for a cause that's literally out of this world!<br><br>
- In addition to Exoplanet Watch, I conduct citizen research for multiple projects via Zooniverse.  Some of them are also sponsored by NASA.  My favorite projects and data samples can be found here:
<br> https://www.zooniverse.org/users/Zooniverse-Volunteer/collections<br><br>
- Aside from astronomy; I've worked on projects involving art, literature, finance, math, and web development.
