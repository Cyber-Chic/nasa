# What is Exoplanet Watch: 
A NASA citizen science project, sponsored by NASA that allows participants to gather and analyze real exoplanet data, contribute their results to a NASA database, and recieve recognition for their work in scientific publications!

# How Do I Conduct My Research?
I use EXOTIC (Exoplanet Timing Interpretation Code) software to analyze data by generating reports and visual light curves.  I then send this to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). Exoplanet Watch incorporates this data into their Exoplanet Watch Results.

# Results: NASA's Official Website
To view my results visit NASA's Exoplanet Watch results page.  Next click on any exoplanet(s) I list below and search for my American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) code which is: MANBA.  From there you can access the light curves I have generated.  Instructions on how to access my results are included on their page under "Find your light curve!"
